# StockPulse
***Group Members:*** Adam Krasilovsky, Eesh Trivedi, Brandon Kong  

**StockPulse** is an interactive React web application built with **Vite** that allows users to explore and analyze stock performance in a modern, visually engaging interface.  
Users can **search for stock tickers**, **visualize live or mock price data**, and **participate in real-time discussions** about market sentiment.  

The app combines **data visualization**, **social interactivity**, and **clean UI design**, demonstrating an understanding of **React architecture**, **UI/UX principles**, and **frontend performance optimization**.  

---

## Project Overview
StockPulse was designed to emulate a lightweight, community-driven stock analysis platform — blending **financial visualization** with **social engagement**.  

Key design goals:
- **Clarity:** Use of consistent fonts, spacing, and alignment for a clean, readable layout.  
- **Feedback:** Interactive visual cues like hover states, tooltips, and like buttons provide immediate user feedback.  
- **Consistency:** Centralized color and font management through CSS variables in `styles.css`.  
- **Scalability:** Modular React components that can be easily expanded with live data and authentication.  

---

## Key Features
- **Navigation & Routing** – Multi-page app powered by `react-router-dom`, featuring Home, Stock, and Style Guide pages.
- **Stock Visualization** – Responsive, dynamic line chart built with `Recharts`, supporting custom time frames (1 Day / 1 Week / 1 Month / Custom Date Range).
- **Discussion Feed** – Interactive post system with likes, filters, and deletion, simulating a live community feed.
- **Style Guide Page** – Built-in reference page displaying the app’s color palette, typography, and icons.
- **Responsive Design** – Flexible grid and row layouts ensure usability across device sizes.
- **Accessibility-Friendly Design** – Semantic HTML elements, labeled inputs, and color contrast awareness built into the design.

## Design Rationale
**Technology Choice:**  
We used **React with Vite** to leverage fast development builds, modular component structure, and efficient hot reloading.  
Vite’s modern ES module-based architecture ensures that the app loads quickly in production and provides an optimal developer experience.  

**User Interface Philosophy:**  
StockPulse’s UI emphasizes simplicity and cognitive clarity:
- Primary interactions (searching, viewing, discussing) are front-loaded for ease of access.  
- Minimal visual clutter supports System I thinking — quick interpretation of stock trends and sentiments.  
- Color choices (teal for accents, navy backgrounds) create a professional, data-oriented visual tone while maintaining strong contrast for accessibility.  

**Scalability:**  
By separating logic (`hooks/`), visuals (`components/`), and data mocks (`data/`), the app can easily integrate:
- Real-time APIs (e.g., Finnhub, Alpha Vantage)
- User authentication
- Persistent database-backed discussions
